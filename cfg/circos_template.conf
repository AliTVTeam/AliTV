### This template file is used by DnadiffCircosParser.pl to generate a circos config file
### The script parses this template line by line, each line is copied into the config file 
### except the lines that start with either 'karyotype', 'chromosomes_reverse', 'chromosomes_order', 'linkfile' or 'highlightfile'.
### Those lines are replaced by the script to point to the right files or sequences accordingly
